# A Curious Mind's blog

This site is a celebration to curiosity and creativity. In this site I will write about projects I have worked on, ideas and resources I have found inspiring or simply content I have enjoyed or learned from.

# About the person writing this site

I am a little human interested in biology, the mind and computers but also in general just a hungry learner and always keen to hear about how the universe works and the things that matter to people.
